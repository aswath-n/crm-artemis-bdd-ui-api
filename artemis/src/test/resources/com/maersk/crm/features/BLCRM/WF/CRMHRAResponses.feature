    Given  I created a consumer with population type "PREGNANT-WOMEN" with data
      | saveConsumerInfo | 29502-03 |
    Given I initiated Eligibility and Enrollment Create API
    And I provide the enrollment and eligibility information to create enrollment
      | consumerId                   | 29502-03.consumerId |
      | isEligibilityRequired        | yes                 |

      | subProgramTypeCode           | MEDICAIDMCHB        |
    And I run create Eligibility and Enrollment API
    And Wait for 5 seconds
    Given I logged into CRM with "Service Account 1" and select a project "BLCRM"
    When I click on initiate contact record
    When I searched consumer created through api with First Name as "fromCaseLoaderApi" and Last Name as "fromCaseLoaderApi"
    And I link the contact to an existing Case or Consumer Profile
    When I click on "Program & Benefit Info" Tab on Contact Dashboard Page
    And I click "Enroll" Button for a consumer
    And I select "PEACH STATE" from Available Plans
    And I click submit button on enrollment update
    And I identify eligible consumers for "CAHMI" survey and store in the list
    And I click "HRA" survey
    Then I click on new survey button
    And I select eligible consumer on the survey slider
    And I click on start survey
    Then Verify following questions must be captured as part of the survey for HRA
